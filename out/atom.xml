The following example uses a ECMAScript 5 properties and also fails.

Is it possible to use `defineProperty` on a frozen object and have it not fail?

There's a lot of power which can be obtained from the properties which are included in ECMAScript 5, but one thing that you can't *normally* do is define a property on a frozen object.

Although the spec doesn't explain it clearly the crux is *if you call `defineProperty` on a frozen object with the value of the existing property it wont fail*.

Where this can become interesting is to improve our [-0 test from last time][1], like so:

    function negativeZero(x) {
       if (x!==0) return false;
       var obj=Object.freeze({z:-0});
       try {
          Object.defineProperty(obj,'z',{value:x});
       } catch (e) {return false};
       return true;
    }

This will only pass for -0, unlike the previous implementation (the idea I got from [here][2]).

The JavaScript [Number][1] type is an implementation of IEEE 754 and it has all the really exciting things that come along with that.

One of the things that is included in the numbering thing is the implementation of `-0`.

If you guessed that `-0` will return `true` then you're right, well at least you're *partially* right (excluding values that coerce to 0), there's actually another value (well, range of values) that will do it...

Any number less than or equal to `-Math.pow(2, -1074)` will also return `-Infinity` when the divisor of 1, thus resulting in true being retured. Sorry I'm not enough of a math nerd to tell you *why*, just that it's an interesting footnote. If you actually want to test for `-0` then you want to do this:

    var fn = function(x) {
        return x === 0 &amp;&amp; (1/x) === -Infinitiy;
    };

Hang on though, why does `-0` equal `0` (or `+0`)?

Well if you take a look [11.9.6 - The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm][2] (and the [11.9.3 The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm][3]) if they are either forms of `0` they will be treated as having the same sign.

And there you have it, that's how to test for `-0` separately from `+0`. The usefulness of this is up to you to work out :P.

JavaScripts [Array.sort][1] method is a bit different to other array manipulation methods, rather than returning a modified version of the array it will actually modify the source array.

I've seen this as the source of many bugs but it's easy to avoid.

## Todays challenge

Sort an array *without* modifying the source array in **the fewest characters possible**.

This weeks question (ok, it ran over two weeks :P) was more about knowing JavaScript APIs.

The shortest way (that I've been able to work out) is to use the [Array.slice][2] method:

    [1,2,3].slice().sort();
    
Passing no arguments to the `slice` method it will default to `0` and return a copy of the array.

`slice` is the easiest way to shallow-clone an array.

With this question we're looking at another seldom used operator in JavaScript... `~` or the [bitwise NOT operator][1]. JavaScript has a number of [bitwise operators][2] and they are used to convert an operand into a sequence of 32 bits.

The way the bitwise NOT operator works is through this formular ([source][3]):

    -(x + 1)

So when we use this with the potential results of the `String.indexOf` we shift the value by one and then rely on the falsy values in JavaScript to take care of it. Let's assume the following code:

    var index = 'abcd'.indexOf('a');
    if(~index) {
        console.log('found it!');
    }

Now if we think back to the above formular, it means we're really doing this:

    if(-(0 + 1))

    if(-(1))

    if(true)

And what if the `index` wasn't found? We'll end up with `-1` wont we? Let's pass that through our bitwise NOT?

    if(-(-1 + 1))

    if(-(0))

    if(false)

And there we go, now we've got a false value properly!

Enjoy the bitwise operators :).

In this weeks question we were looking at a common mistake that people make when using the `setInterval` method in JavaScript. With `setInterval` the function that you pass in will always be executed when the timeout period rolls over. This is why you can run into an issue when you're using it to perform operations which you don't control the duration of, a server call.

Because of this a new design pattern has come into common use, the [Recursive SetTimeout Pattern][1]. The idea behind this pattern is that you perform your operation in a `setTimeout` callback function (using the time period you would in the interval) and within the timeout execution you kick off a new timeout.

Here is the code for the answer:

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1321278.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

What I've done is added a name to the function, `go`, and added a new call in the success callback that will kick off the new timeout call.

*I forgot to mention that this weeks post was brought to us by [Adam Ahmed][1] from Atlassian (sorry Adam!).*

This week we've taken a look at an interesting part of the JavaScript type coercion. For this we need to take a dive into the ECMAScript 5 spec, in particular section [11.9.3 The Abstract Equality Comparison Algorithm][2].

It all comes down to how the left and right hand side parts of the equality comparision works. The first thing to note is that the right-hand side part will actually be a `boolean` type, due to the [Logical NOT operator][3] being applied. This will ultimately be converted to a number for the next part of the comparison.

Then with the left hand side (assuming it's a [primative value][4]) an attempt will be made to convert it to a [number][5]. The thing with this is that if it's something such as an **empty array** or **empty string** it'll end up as a **0** which is a falsy value, resulting in `0 == false`!

But there's another time that this can happen, you can do it with objects. As mentioned the primative types are converted to a number, but object's are not, so how can you do it with an object? You need to override the [valueOf][6] method and make it return false. That means you can do this:

    var a = { valueOf: function() { return false; } }

Since we're overriding `valueOf` the expression `a == !a` will return true. To understand why we need to look back at the Abstract Edquality Commparison Algorithm. First off the expression `!a` which is the same as `!{ ... }` will **always** return `false` (as objects are coerced to `true`) and with an object when the `ToPrimative` converson happens it'll look at the [Default Value][7], which in turn is requested from valueOf, resulting in `false == false`!

And this is yet another reason why you want to watch out how you're constructing your equality expressions.

Happy hacking.

* * *

The result of executing the function **b** is **2**, and this is because of the [comma is an operator][2] in JavaScript! The comma operator is the very bottom of the operator evaluation stack, meaning a trailing comma will cause following commands to be evaluated and in this case, returned.

The comma operator is quite often seen used in for loops like so:

`for(var i = 0, j = array.length; i &lt; j; i++)`

Here we're using the comma operator to chain variable assignments.

There's a lot of interesting things which can be done with the comma operator, [have a read here for more ideas][3].

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug is that the method &lt;code&gt;showData&lt;/code&gt; does not exist on the &lt;code&gt;window&lt;/code&gt; object so when the callback from the AJAX response happens it will fall over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens because of the way the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is handled within JavaScript. In JavaScript the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value is scoped to the current function and is not at a class level like you would expect in compiled languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can use JavaScript closures to ensure that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t catch you out, if you assign the &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; value to a variable before the callback executes (eg: the top of the &lt;code&gt;getData&lt;/code&gt; function) it&amp;rsquo;ll then be available through that variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you see a lot of JavaScript code with lines like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;var that = this;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Technically the answer to this weeks question is &lt;em&gt;it depends&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;because timers work slightly different in each JavaScript runtime but to be closes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#timers&quot;&gt;the spec&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;you're looking at Han.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is that according to the spec the minimum for a timeout in JavaScript is 4 milliseconds and any timeout that is less than 4 milliseconds will be increased to 4 milliseconds. This means that the two functions have &lt;strong&gt;the same timeout value&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and they will be executed in the order they are added to the timeout queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you're using small timeouts be sure to test them across your different runtimes so that they actually work as expected.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;The following code snippet &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; create an &lt;strong&gt;array&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; does it create instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it doesn't create an array what is the &lt;strong&gt;shortest and&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;safest&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;way to &lt;strong&gt;combine&lt;/strong&gt; all variables into a &lt;strong&gt;single array&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;Happy hacking.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week we've been looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://es5.github.com/#x11.6.1&quot;&gt;Addition Operator&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and how it operates with arrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result that you end up with from the log statement is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1,2,345,6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The reason for this is because the addition operator will call the &lt;a href=&quot;http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.4.2&quot;&gt;toString on the array&lt;/a&gt;, which will join all the items in the array into a single string, separated by a comma (although the latter is not properly defined in the spec).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;If you want to actually concatinate the arrays together you should use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://es5.github.com/#x15.4.4.4&quot;&gt;concat&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;method on the array prototype. This method can be use like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a.concat(b,c)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't trust the provider of the arrays or you want to be sure that you're not using a concat method that has been changed you could do it like this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Array.prototype.concat.call(a, b, c)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sorry for the late question this week, I'm currently at a conference and haven't had time to get a big question together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the following code example under what scenario could you receive a &lt;strong&gt;false positive &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;from the method? Knowing that there is the potential for a false positive how can you fix it &lt;strong&gt;while still keeping the if statement &lt;/strong&gt;(note: you can change the the condition) using &lt;strong&gt;the least number of characters possible&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I was looking at a common mistake with regards to JavaScript falsey values. If you remember your JavaScript theory you'll know that there's a lot of different falsey values in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that has been coming up a lot in JavaScript design patterns of recently is the use of the &lt;strong&gt;double-not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;operator, or &lt;strong&gt;!!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-not operator is useful as it will &lt;strong&gt;force a boolean&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a scenario like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking a boolean result &lt;em&gt;as a boolean&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ie - not as an assumed boolean)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returning a result from a function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you see a &lt;strong&gt;!!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;in your JavaScript know it's there to force a type to be a boolean.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today's JavaScript quiz has been submitted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/apostopher&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rahul Devaskar&lt;/a&gt;, don't forget you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaron-powell.com/about&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submit yours too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without using a browser what is the &lt;strong&gt;output&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;following code&lt;/strong&gt;? If it &lt;strong&gt;fails&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;why does it fail and &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;would you fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 point for the correct output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 point for knowing if fails or not and how you would fix it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this weeks JavaScript quiz we've been looking at the idea of &lt;strong&gt;Function Expressions&lt;/strong&gt;. Function Expressions are a pattern which is becoming more common in JavaScript code samples (and as a recommended coding standard) and it is when you assign a varaible to a function rather than naming the function, &lt;strong&gt;var fn = function() { ... }&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;rather than &lt;strong&gt;function fn() { ... }&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an interesting thing with Function Expressions&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;they are created by evaluating the function&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see section 11.2.5 of the ECMAScript specification).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;What's interesting about this is we are &lt;strong&gt;evaluting the function&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;not just taking it as a straight assignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next point of note from this question is that we've also got an assumption about &lt;strong&gt;automatic semicolon insersion&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(7.9 in the spec), that it will be included on the end of the line function expression, but here's the funny part, parenthesis is handled, they are treated as the start of the arguments for the previous function. Serious, check the last paragraph in section 7.9.2!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means the answer this week is that the code will &lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;, and it'll fail with a &lt;strong&gt;TypeError&lt;/strong&gt;. The reason is &lt;strong&gt;evaluation wont happen on the anonymous function, but on the result of the first&lt;/strong&gt;, this means that &lt;strong&gt;it will attempted to execute RedGreen,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;which will be a string, which cannot be invoked as a function!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To then fix the code all that needs to be done is remove the final &lt;strong&gt;()&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;so that the function is passed in rather than the evaluation, resulting in &lt;strong&gt;sayColor&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;equaling &lt;strong&gt;RedGreen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So scoring breakdown is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 point for knowing the output is a TypeError&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 point for knowing that it failed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 point for knowing that you can fix it by removing the final &lt;strong&gt;()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what's the lesson, always include your semicolons, especially if you're using function expressions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: The fact that there was an implied global variable in the function was just a mistake when writing the code, nothing else ;).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

<p>Without executing the following code snippet, <em>who shot first</em>? (Accordnig to the majority of JavaScript runtimes)</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1225982.js"></script>
<p>In addition do the first two timeouts execute in place or not? If not, when do they execute?</p>

<p>The answer I was looking for to this weeks question is <strong>Han</strong>&nbsp;because after all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_shot_first">Han always shot first</a>&nbsp;;). Technically the answer to this weeks question is <em>it depends</em>&nbsp;because timers work slightly different in each JavaScript runtime but to be closes to <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#timers">the spec</a>&nbsp;you're looking at Han.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that according to the spec the minimum for a timeout in JavaScript is 4 milliseconds and any timeout that is less than 4 milliseconds will be increased to 4 milliseconds. This means that the two functions have <strong>the same timeout value</strong>&nbsp;and they will be executed in the order they are added to the timeout queue.</p>
<p>So next time you're using small timeouts be sure to test them across your different runtimes so that they actually work as expected.</p>

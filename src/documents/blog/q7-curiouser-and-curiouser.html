<p>In this weeks JavaScript quiz we've been looking at the idea of <strong>Function Expressions</strong>. Function Expressions are a pattern which is becoming more common in JavaScript code samples (and as a recommended coding standard) and it is when you assign a varaible to a function rather than naming the function, <strong>var fn = function() { ... }</strong>&nbsp;rather than <strong>function fn() { ... }</strong>.</p>
<p>There's an interesting thing with Function Expressions&nbsp;<em>they are created by evaluating the function</em>&nbsp;(see section 11.2.5 of the ECMAScript specification).&nbsp;<br />What's interesting about this is we are <strong>evaluting the function</strong>&nbsp;not just taking it as a straight assignment.</p>
<p>The next point of note from this question is that we've also got an assumption about <strong>automatic semicolon insersion</strong>&nbsp;(7.9 in the spec), that it will be included on the end of the line function expression, but here's the funny part, parenthesis is handled, they are treated as the start of the arguments for the previous function. Serious, check the last paragraph in section 7.9.2!</p>
<p>That means the answer this week is that the code will <strong>fail</strong>, and it'll fail with a <strong>TypeError</strong>. The reason is <strong>evaluation wont happen on the anonymous function, but on the result of the first</strong>, this means that <strong>it will attempted to execute RedGreen,</strong>&nbsp;which will be a string, which cannot be invoked as a function!</p>
<p>To then fix the code all that needs to be done is remove the final <strong>()</strong>&nbsp;so that the function is passed in rather than the evaluation, resulting in <strong>sayColor</strong>&nbsp;equaling <strong>RedGreen</strong>.</p>
<p>So scoring breakdown is:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 point for knowing the output is a TypeError</li>
<li>1 point for knowing that it failed</li>
<li>1 point for knowing that you can fix it by removing the final <strong>()</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And what's the lesson, always include your semicolons, especially if you're using function expressions!</p>

<p>PS: The fact that there was an implied global variable in the function was just a mistake when writing the code, nothing else ;).</p>

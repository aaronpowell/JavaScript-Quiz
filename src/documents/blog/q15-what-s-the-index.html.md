slug: Can you make indexOf play nicer with boolean statements?

Take the following JavaScript code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1326706.js"> </script>

How can I change the *if condition statement* so that I can compare against `true` while still using the `String.indexOf` method?

Post your JavaScript as a comment. Comments will be held in the moderation queue until the answer is posted. Full answer and explanation will be appended to this post around 72 - 96 hours after the question is posted.

If you don't want your answer public, please post a comment like 'playing at home' so I can at least guage how many people are participating and whether the questions are useful.

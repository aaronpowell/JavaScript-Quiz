A developer has been asked to write some JavaScript which will perform an AJAX request every 30 seconds and display the returned data on the page.

The code produced by the developer looks as follows:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1308134.js"> </script>

What problem can come up if the server load fluctuates, resulting in the response time changing?

How would you change the code to negate the problem?

Post your JavaScript as a comment. Comments will be held in the moderation queue until the answer is posted. Full answer and explanation will be appended to this post around 72 - 96 hours after the question is posted.

If you don't want your answer public, please post a comment like 'playing at home' so I can at least guage how many people are participating and whether the questions are useful.

Good Luck :).

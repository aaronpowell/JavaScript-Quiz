<p><em>Sorry for the late question this week, I'm currently at a conference and haven't had time to get a big question together.</em></p>
<p>Taking the following code example under what scenario could you receive a <strong>false positive </strong><em style="font-weight: bold;"></em>from the method? Knowing that there is the potential for a false positive how can you fix it <strong>while still keeping the if statement </strong>(note: you can change the the condition) using <strong>the least number of characters possible</strong>?</p>

<hr />
<p>This week I was looking at a common mistake with regards to JavaScript falsey values. If you remember your JavaScript theory you'll know that there's a lot of different falsey values in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Something that has been coming up a lot in JavaScript design patterns of recently is the use of the <strong>double-not</strong>&nbsp;operator, or <strong>!!</strong>.</p>
<p>The double-not operator is useful as it will <strong>force a boolean</strong>&nbsp;in a scenario like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking a boolean result <em>as a boolean</em>&nbsp;(ie - not as an assumed boolean)</li>
<li>Returning a result from a function</li>
</ul>
<p>So next time you see a <strong>!!</strong>&nbsp;in your JavaScript know it's there to force a type to be a boolean.</p>
